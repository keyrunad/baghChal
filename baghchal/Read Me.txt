<<<Installing Pygame on Windows>>>

    pip install pygame

<<<Installing Pygame on Mac for Python 3>>>

The following is taken from a Pygame Issue Tracker thread.

---First install the Mercurial version control system:

    brew install mercurial

---Then do the same for the git version control system, which is needed by a dependency package:

    brew install git

---Now install all the dependencies of Pygame:

    brew install sdl sdl_image sdl_mixer sdl_ttf smpeg portmidi

---Almost there! To install Pygame now, we will use pip. Go and get it by running:

    /usr/local/share/python3/easy_install pip

---And now, finally:

    /usr/local/share/python3/pip install hg+http://bitbucket.org/pygame/pygame

---After this is done, verify that it is working:

    python3
    >>> import pygame
    >>> pygame.init()
    (6, 0)
    >>> pygame.display.set_mode((800, 600))
    <Surface(800x600x32 SW)>
    >>> raise SystemExit
